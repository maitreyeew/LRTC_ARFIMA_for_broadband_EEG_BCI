# Movement Intention Prediction by Modelling Broadband EEG with Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) and ARFIMA for Brain-Computer Interface 

This is the code for predicting voluntary movement intention from single-trial broadband EEG using LRTC and ARFIMA modelling for applications in brain-computer interface (BCI).  

This code is provided for the analysis in the following papers:
